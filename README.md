# Fuji-Web: AI based Full Browser Automation ðŸ—»

Fuji-Web is an intelligent AI partner that understands the userâ€™s intent, navigates websites autonomously, and executes tasks on the userâ€™s behalf while explaining each action step.

### Demo
https://github.com/H1B0B0/fuji-webfuji-web/assets/1001890/88a2fa12-31d9-4856-be67-27dcf9f1e634

## How does it work?

**Please read [our blog post](https://blog.normalcomputing.ai/posts/2024-05-22-introducing-fuji-web/fuji-web.html) for a demo video, benchmarks and deep-dive technical overview!**

## Installing and Running

### Download and Install the extension in your browser

1. Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/H1B0B0/fuji-webfuji-web/releases), find the latest version of the extension and download "fuji-extension.zip".
2. Unzip the file.
3. Load your extension on Chrome by doing the following:
   1. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
   2. Toggle `Developer mode`
   3. Click on `Load unpacked extension`
   4. Select the unzipped folder

### Use the extension

*Please note that you may need to refresh the page for the extension to work.*

1. Find the Fuji icon in the top right corner of your browser and click on it to open the sidepanel.
2. Create or access an existing [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) or [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys) and paste it in the provided box. This key will be stored in your browser, and will not be uploaded to a third party.
3. Finally, navigate to a webpage you want Fuji-Web and type in the task you want it to perform.

_Note: all prompts (text and image) are sent directly to the API of your selection. Fuji-Web does not attempt to collect any information from you._

### Build the extension

If you want to build the extension from source, follow these instructions:

1. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). The development was done on Node v20 but it should work with some lower versions.
2. Clone this repository
3. Install `pnpm` globally: `npm install -g pnpm`
4. Run `pnpm install` 
5. Run `pnpm dev` to start the development server, or `pnpm build` to build the extension.

When loading the extension, you will need to load the `dist` folder created by the build process.

## Roadmap

- Expose API for easy integration with browser automation frameworks (e.g. Puppeteer, Playwright, Selenium)
- Add support for more complex & cross-tab workflows
- Add support for more browsing behaviors (select from dropdown, extract content from entire page etc.)
- Add support for saving workflows
- Add support for sharing workflows & instructions with others
- Create wikipedia-like knowledge base where users can work together to create knowledge that can improve the Fuji-Web's performance

## Credits

- Fuji-Web's image annotation method was inspired by Microsoft's [UFO paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07939).
- Fuji as a tool that lives in the browser sidepanel was inspired by [TaxyAI's browser extension](https://github.com/TaxyAI/browser-extension). We also used some of its UI code.
- The Chrome extension set-up leveraged an awesome boilerplate project [Jonghakseo/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react-vite](https://github.com/Jonghakseo/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react-vite).
- The Fuji logo is from [Toss Face](https://emojipedia.org/toss-face) Emoji design set.
