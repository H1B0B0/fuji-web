## Common Issues and Solutions

### Extension Not Loading

**Symptom**: The Fuji-Web extension doesn't appear in your browser or won't load.

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure your browser is compatible with Fuji-Web. Currently, Fuji-Web supports Chrome.
2. Verify that `Developer mode` is enabled in `chrome://extensions/`
3. (Only when you are building it from source) Make sure you've loaded the extension from the `dist` folder.
4. Restart your browser as this can resolve many loading issues.

### API Key Problems

**Symptom**: Issues related to the OpenAI API key, such as authentication errors or features not working due to key issues. e.g., 404 The model `gpt-4-vision-preview` does not exist or you do not have access to it.

**Solutions**:
1. Make sure you entered a valid OpenAI API key. Note that keys can expire, so verify if yours is still active.
2. Ensure that your OpenAI API key has the necessary permissions. Visit https://platform.openai.com/playground/chat to check your permissions. Lack of credits can also restrict access to certain models.

### Dom Actions Problems

**Symptom**: Fuji-Web did not perform dom actions properly.

**Solutions**:
1. Currently, Fuji-Web does not support running in the background. If you open a new tab or navigate away from the website that Fuji-Web is working on, some actions may fail. Please stay on the website where you execute Fuji-Web. 

### Custom Knowledge Base Problems

**Symptom**: After adding custom knowledge, Fuji-Web crashed or did not perform according to the new knowledge about the active tab.

**Solutions**:
1. Currently, Fuji-Web only supports basic entry validation for custom knowledge. Make sure you entered the correct host name and correct regular expressions if using a custom URL Matching Pattern. 

### Voice Mode Problems

**Symptom**: Fuji-Web did not capture speech.

**Solutions**:
1. Check if Fuji-Web has microphone access in the browser. When you turn on the voice mode in settings, the microphone access dialog should pop up in the browser; please select "allow".
2. If the dialog didn't pop up, right-click the Fuji-Web icon in the extensions group and select "View Web Permissions". Then select "Allow" for Microphone.
